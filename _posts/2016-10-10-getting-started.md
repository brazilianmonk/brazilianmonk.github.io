# [Brazilian Monk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7lcXiaCyi_qzq92qrBM3fA)
This is my personal channel, where I upload dhamma talks, lessons I give, etc.

# [Monkish English](add website)
This is my ongoing project of teaching English to monks. I began informally in Myanmar and in Sri Lanka, and now the lessons are part of the official course of the [IIT](https://www.theravado.com/) where I'm currently studying. 
Since giving lessons takes quite some effort, I record the material in order to make it available for the students to review and for helping others who may come across it.

# Future plans
## Channel specifically for Dhamma recitations
## Other languages
I'll probably make other channels specifically for content in Spanish or Portuguese, other languages I know.

## YouTube Projects

The things we do -- lectures, talks, writings, etc. -- are quite difficult to do (!), so I began sharing them online to cause a greater impact, keep track of what I do, and make the most of things. 

Below, you will find my current YT channel and plans for future projects.

### Current Channel
#### [Ariyañāṇa Bhikkhu (Stefano Domit Cervo)]

This is right now where I keep all the YouTube content I make. The main playlists are English Clasees, Abhidhamma lectures, and Recitations. 

```html
<a href="[[Insert link to a video or playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXMGw7BI8gLVn_DKTX82nQ2Q0uWdUJpLT&feature=shared)]" target="_blank">📺 Watch my latest video or playlist</a>
<a href="[[Insert channel link](https://youtube.com/@anb_sdc?feature=shared)]" target="_blank">🔗 Visit the channel</a>
```

### Future Projects
I have plans to expand my YouTube presence with new projects:
- Buddhist Recitations / Chanting such as [this one](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXMGw7BI8gLWOvfpN_v_B9NaC6iJ5Zok8&feature=shared)
- A channel for Dhamma in Spanish.
- A channel for Dhamma in Portuguese.

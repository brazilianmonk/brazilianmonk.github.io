# Hi!

I'm a former flamenco dancer made monk, and this website has a good share of my projects, studies, interests, readings, writings, talks, and what not. 

There will be a good amount of Buddhism, meditation, chantings, videos, pics, and maybe some books as well. Feel free to make use of any content and get in touch with me through the contact section or social media links.
